# Heater API Channel Configuration
# This file defines the heater channels to be controlled by the API.
# Each channel represents a heater connected to a specific GPIO pin and associated with a Lakeshore sensor.

channels:
  # Primary heater channel (current default configuration)
  - channel_id: "heater_1"
    name: "Primary Heater"
    gpio_pin: 18 # GPIO BCM pin number
    sensor_channel: 1 # Lakeshore Model 240 sensor channel number
    enabled: true

  # Example: Additional channels can be added below
  # - channel_id: "heater_2"
  #   name: "Secondary Heater"
  #   gpio_pin: 23
  #   sensor_channel: 2
  #   enabled: true

  # - channel_id: "heater_3"
  #   name: "Backup Heater"
  #   gpio_pin: 24
  #   sensor_channel: 3
  #   enabled: false  # Can be disabled without removing from config
